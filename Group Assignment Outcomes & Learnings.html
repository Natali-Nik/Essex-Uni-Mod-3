									<h2>Key Lessons and Outcomes</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This group project reinforced my strengths in organization, project management, collaboration, research, writing, and strategic business thinking. I gained valuable exposure to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using Python and its libraries, which were relatively new to me. The experience not only improved my technical skills but also provided a realistic work context and relevant insights into predicting profitable business cases.</p>

											<h3>Unit 6: Development Team Project - Overview of My Responsibilities</h3>
										</header>
										<p><strong>My Responsibilities:</strong> In the group assignment, my responsibilities included conducting academic and market research to develop a meaningful business question and serving as the project lead. As project lead, I organized meetings, prepared agendas, summarized content, ensured accountability, and created structure to keep the team on track.</p>
										</p><strong>Strengths and Optimization:</strong> I showed strenghts in organization, project management, creating structure, and facilitating collaboration, which were all important for maintaining an efficient workflow. My research and writing skills, along with my ability to prepare and lead effective meetings, also significantly contributed to the project’s success. However, I aim to improve my technical skills further, such as Python programming, code review, data analysis tools, exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations with code. These enhancements would equip me better to take on more technical roles in future projects.</p>

											<h3>Unit 6: Development Team Project - Outcomes and Lessons Learnt</h3>
										</header>
										<p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> The project "From Data to Decisions: Exploring Airbnb Market Dynamics in New York City", aimed to utilize the Airbnb NYC dataset and machine learning models to predict growth trends and average pricing for 2019. The methodology involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling, using Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Key findings revealed that property types reflect neighborhood trends across NYC.</p>
										<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Recommendations included implementing dynamic pricing based on borough-specific trends, targeted marketing in growth areas like northern Brooklyn and Queens, regularly updating datasets, and enhancing private room features to attract solo travelers and couples.</p>
										<p><strong>Lessons Learnt:</strong> From this project, I learned the importance of clear communication and organization in team settings. Using a dedicated WhatsApp group for transparent decision-making worked well, ensuring everyone stayed informed and engaged. Having a project lead to manage time, agendas, and deadlines was crucial for maintaining focus, while assigning roles based on individual strengths in the first meeting streamlined the workflow and improved efficiency.</p>
